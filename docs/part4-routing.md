## Routing

Real apps are have many parts/functions, and Web frameworkss almost universally *route* different URLs to each function.  For example, consider Instagrm:

- `https://www.instagram.com` -- my timeline 
- `https://www.instagram.com/{username}/` -- user page for `{username}` 
- `https://www.instagram.com/p/{id}/` -- a single photo

# Decision Point:

## Match-based routing, or object traversal?
