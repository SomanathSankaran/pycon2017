- part 1: intro and throat clearing
    - what is a web framework?
    - BYO vs BOB
    - show the (final) example app
    - ex1: get your kit together
        - objective: make sure your python works, know how to run wsgi apps
        - part 1: write code (it_works.py), run with `python it_works.py`
        - part 2: install waitress, run with waitress
            - `cd ex1; waitress-serve it_works:demo_app`

- part 2: WSGI handling
    - introduce WSGI, handler, etc
    - ex2: write a wsgi app
        - objective: understand wsgi (a bit), write an app by hand
        - html, "hello pycon'"
        - show output, don't show how
        - hint: could start by replacing demo_app
        - bonus: add ?name=foo support (will require fucking with unicode!)

- part 2: request/response abstractions
    - wsgi app sucks (see above w/unicode!)
    - request/response abstraction as response
