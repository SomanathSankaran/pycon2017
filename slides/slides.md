## Goals and Expectations

By the end of this tutorial, you should have **implemented a (very) minimal web framework**, from scratch, and be able to use it to **understand what frameworks do under the hood** and the **choices web framework authors face**.

This is an **intermediate-level, hands-on** course â€” expect to spend the majority of the time writing code.

## Agenda

1. Introduction & Getting Started
1. WSGI
1. HTTP request/response abstractions
1. Routing
1. Controllers, Views and Templates
1. Data storage
1. Closing thoughts

# Part 1: Introduction

## What's a web framework?

xxx

---


    - BYO vs BOB
    - I'm sticking to the standard library, which is a bad idea that'll quickly become apparent
    - example code is EXAMPLES, very little error handling etc
    - show the (final) example app
    - ex1: get your kit together
        - objective: make sure your python works, know how to run wsgi apps
        - part 1: write code (it_works.py), run with `python it_works.py`
        - part 2: install waitress, run with waitress
            - `cd ex1; waitress-serve it_works:demo_app`

---

# Part 2: WSGI

    - introduce WSGI, handler, etc
    - ex2: write a wsgi app
        - objective: understand wsgi (a bit), write an app by hand
        - html, "hello pycon'"
        - show output, don't show how
        - hint: could start by replacing demo_app
        - bonus: add ?name=foo support (will require fucking with unicode!)

---

# Part 3: Request/response abstractions

    - wsgi app sucks (see above w/unicode!)
    - request/response abstraction as response
        - where it breaks down (websockets, http2)
    - ex3: write request/response abstraction
        - objective: understand wrappers, parsing wsgi env, etc
        - show: final code, decorator,nothing else
    - after: show code, talk about all the ways it breaks
    - show werkzeug version, compare a few things
    - admission: in many ways, we're building a really shitty werkzeug
    - DECISION POINT: by-hand vs werkzeug
        - if you want to struggle, keep doing things by hand
        - if you want the exercises to be easy, keep using werkzeug
        - if I were building Django from scratch today, I'd use werkzeug

- Let's make this a framework
    - framework vs lib
        - thinking about entry points
        - is Flask a framework?
    - the initial startup: how does a framework/library know what to run?
        - Flask-style: run the app!
        - Django-style: what the heck to run?
            - DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE oh now I get it
    - DECISION POINT: framework or library
    - ex4: do a framework, or a library
        - objective: think about the above
        - figure out entry points
        - goal: shuold have a framework/lib, and your app alone (which imports), and be able to invoke it
    - my solution: introducing bizkit
        - (django's a great mucisin, limp bizkit was named the 3rd worst band of the 90s by rolling stone)
